# GPULZ: Optimizing LZSS Lossless Compression for Multi-byte Data on Modern GPUs

Currently, GPULZ performs compression and decompression together, but we plan to provide options for performing compression and decompression separately in the future.

## Recommended Environment
- Linux OS with NVIDIA GPUs
- GCC (>= 7.3.0)
- CUDA (>= 11.0)

## Compile
Please use the following command to compile GPULZ. You will get the executable ```gpulz```.
```
make -j
```

## Configuration
Please modify the following code in ```gpulz.cu``` for different configurations.
```
#define BLOCK_SIZE 2048     // in unit of byte, the size of one data block
#define WINDOW_SIZE 32      // in unit of datatype, maximum 255, the size of the sliding window, so as the maximum match length
#define INPUT_TYPE uint32_t // define input type, since c++ doesn't support runtime data type defination
```

## Download Data
Please use ```get_sample_data.sh``` to download the sample data.

```
./get_sample_data.sh
```

## Run GPULZ
Please use the below command to run ```gpulz``` on a float32 data.
```
./gpulz -i [input data path]
```

For example,
```
./gpulz -i QCLOUDf48.bin.f32.errctrl.1e-3
```

Finally, you can observe the output including compression ratio and compression/decompression end-to-end throughputs.
```
compression ratio: 11.5429
compression e2e throughput: 20.9908 GB/s
decompression e2e throughput: 34.4679 GB/s
```

To obtain more accurate timing for the compression kernel, please use ```nsys``` before the execution command, like
```
nsys profile --stats=true ./gpulz -i QCLOUDf48.bin.f32.errctrl.1e-3
```

You will observe the time for each kernel, i.e., compressKernelI (compression kernel I), compressKernelIII (compression kernel III), cub::DeviceScanKernel (CUB prefix sum kernel), and decompressKernel (decompression kernel).
